## Example Posts

### Good example:
```
We just shipped an AI MVP in 4 weeks.

The client came to us after 3 months of failed attempts with their in-house team.

What changed?
- Smaller scope (MVP, not "the vision")
- Pre-built components instead of from scratch
- Daily demos instead of weekly updates

Sometimes the fastest path forward is admitting you need help.
```

### Avoid:
```
🚀 Exciting news! We are thrilled to announce that our cutting-edge AI solutions are transforming the industry! Stay tuned for more innovations! #AI #Innovation #Future
```

## Hashtag Strategy
Use sparingly (2-3 max):

Avoid overused: #AI #Innovation #Entrepreneur #Hustle
