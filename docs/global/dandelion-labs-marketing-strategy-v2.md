# Dandelion Labs Marketing Strategy v2.0

**Prepared by:** Robert Claw  
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting Leon's Review

---

## Executive Summary

This strategy shifts Dandelion Labs from generic "AI content" to a precision-targeted funnel designed to convert early-stage founders into clients. The core insight: founders don't want an agency—they want runway extension. Our marketing should prove we're the fastest path to that outcome.

---

## 1. Target Audience Deep Dive

### Primary: Pre-Seed to Series A Founders
**Profile:**
- Raising in next 3-12 months
- Building B2B or B2C SaaS products
- Has product idea but lacks AI/ML expertise in-house
- Burning runway on slow development or failed AI attempts
- Likely technical enough to understand what we do

**Pain Points:**
- "VCs are asking about AI and we don't have it"
- "We tried building in-house for 3 months and got nowhere"
- "Every agency quotes 4-6 months and $150K+"
- "We need to ship before demo day / next board meeting"

**Where They Hang Out:**
- X/Twitter (startup tech circles)
- LinkedIn (for fundraising signaling)
- YC forums, Indie Hackers, r/startups, Hacker News
- Podcast guests on founder-focused shows
- Slack communities (Lenny's, First Round, OnDeck)

### Secondary: Startup CTOs / First Technical Hires
**Profile:**
- Tasked with "add AI to the product"
- Smart enough to know they don't want to build the whole stack
- Looking for a team that speaks their language

## 2. Brand Voice & Positioning

### Voice Guidelines
| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Direct, confident, slightly irreverent | Corporate speak, "we'd be happy to..." |
| Use specific numbers ("5 weeks, $35K") | Vague claims ("fast and affordable") |
| Acknowledge tradeoffs honestly | Pretend we can do everything |
| Technical credibility without jargon | Dumb it down OR over-complicate |
| Speak to founders as peers | Talk down or talk up |

### Core Positioning Statement
> We ship AI-powered MVPs in 2-3 weeks for early-stage startups. Not demos. Production. You focus on fundraising—we'll make sure you have something to fundraise with.

### Differentiation
| Us | Typical AI Agency |
|-----|-------------------|
| 2-3 weeks to production | 4-6 months |
| Fixed scope, fast decisions | Endless discovery phases |
| Founder-to-founder communication | Account managers and steering committees |
| We say no to bad fits | Take any project for revenue |

## 3. Marketing Funnel Strategy

### TOFU (Top of Funnel): Awareness
**Goal:** Get founders to know we exist and remember us when they need AI.

**Tactics:**
1. **LinkedIn Thought Leadership** (Leon's personal account)
   - 3-4x/week posting
   - Hot takes on AI development, startup mistakes, speed vs perfection
   - "What I learned shipping 12 AI products" style posts
   - Comment strategy on investor/founder posts

2. **X/Twitter Presence** (@dandelionlabsio)
   - Daily tweets with actionable insights
   - Threads that break down real client wins (anonymized)
   - Engagement with #buildinpublic, AI, and startup communities
   - Quote-tweet reactions to AI news with founder lens

3. **Blog SEO Content**
   - "How to evaluate AI vendors" (we're already transparent)
   - "The real cost of building AI in-house"
   - "2-week AI MVP checklist"
   - "What VCs actually look for in AI startups"

**Content Pillars:**
- 🚀 Speed: Why 2 weeks beats 6 months
- 💰 Cost: Real numbers, budget transparency
- 🎯 Focus: Building the 80%, not the 100%
- 🔧 Technical: RAG, agents, LLM gotchas (credibility)
- 💬 Founder Stories: Case studies, lessons learned

### MOFU (Middle of Funnel): Consideration
**Goal:** Get interested founders to engage deeper and self-qualify.

**Tactics:**
1. **Lead Magnets**
   - "AI MVP Scoping Template" (PDF) — they fill in, we can use for discovery
   - "AI Budget Calculator" — interactive tool showing cost comparison
   - "Pre-Fundraise AI Checklist" — 10 things VCs want to see

2. **Email Nurture Sequence**
   - 5-email sequence for lead magnet downloads
   - Mix of value (tips) and proof (case studies)
   - Soft CTA to book discovery call

3. **Case Study Library**
   - 3-5 detailed case studies with:
     - Problem → Solution → Results → Timeline → Investment
   - Video testimonials if possible

4. **Newsletter**
   - Weekly "Ship It Sunday" edition
   - What we learned, what we shipped, what's broken in AI
   - Builds relationship over time

### BOFU (Bottom of Funnel): Conversion
**Goal:** Make booking a call feel low-risk and high-value.

**Tactics:**
1. **Discovery Call Positioning**
   - 20 minutes, no sales deck
   - "We'll tell you if we're a fit—and if not, point you elsewhere"
   - Free scoping conversation, not a pitch

2. **Social Proof on Site**
   - Logos (when allowed)
   - "11 AI products shipped" counter
   - Specific results ("60% support reduction", "23% conversion lift")

3. **Retargeting**
   - LinkedIn retargeting ads to blog visitors
   - "Still researching AI development?" → Direct to case studies

## 6. Lead Generation Tactics

### Immediate Actions
1. **Scout App Activation** — Use the lead gen tool to find:
   - Founders posting about AI struggles on X/Reddit/HN
   - Startups that raised recently (Crunchbase signals)
   - Companies hiring "AI engineers" (proxy for need)

2. **Outbound via LinkedIn**
   - Connection requests with personalized notes
   - Not pitch-first, value-first
   - "Saw your post about X, here's a resource that might help"

3. **Community Participation**
   - Answer questions in YC, Indie Hackers, r/SaaS
   - Be helpful first, mention Dandelion Labs naturally if relevant
   - Build reputation as the "fast AI guy"

### Partner/Referral Strategy
- Reach out to VC scouts and angels who back AI startups
- Offer referral fee or intro calls for portfolio companies
- Partner with non-competing agencies (design, no-code) for referrals

2. **Provide client stories** — I can anonymize and write them up
3. **Record video testimonials** — when clients are willing
4. **Your LinkedIn login** — or approve posts before publishing
5. **OK to start posting to @dandelionlabsio?** — I'll draft, you approve first batch

## Summary

We're not just creating content—we're building a machine that converts founders into clients.

**The formula:**
- Awareness: Show we exist and ship fast
- Consideration: Prove it with real numbers and case studies
- Conversion: Make booking a call feel like the obvious next step

No more spray-and-pray content. Everything ties back to "book a discovery call."
