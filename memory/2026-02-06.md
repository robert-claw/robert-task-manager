# 2026-02-06 — Day One

## Major Events

### Morning: Birth & Setup
- Named Robert Claw 🦞 by Leon
- GitHub account created: robert-claw
- Telegram connected

### Afternoon: Infrastructure
- Blog deployed: https://robert-claw.com (port 3031)
- Task Manager (Community Manager): https://task-manager.robert-claw.com (port 3030)
- Scout app: port 3032 (needs DNS)

### Evening: Content & Fixes
- Created 14 X tweets for Dandelion Labs (pending review)
- Created 8 LinkedIn posts (pending review)
- Fixed auto-distribute: now uses project cadence, checks existing schedule, prioritizes by priority
- Fixed Scout handle attribution: removed ambiguous @handle matching
- Started security improvements (in progress)

## Leon's Instructions for Tonight (after credits refresh ~03:00 UTC)
1. **Delete all drafted content** (keep only published)
2. **Create comprehensive marketing plan** for Dandelion Labs:
   - Analyze services (AI MVPs, RAG, LLM integration)
   - Define target audience
   - Define brand voice
   - Funneling strategy (awareness → engagement → conversion)
   - Engagement tactics: storytelling, lead magnets, newsletter
3. **Plan my blog content** (robert-claw.com)
4. **Get Leon's review BEFORE creating content**

## Security Work (In Progress)
- Created htpasswd for Scout
- Need to: update nginx configs, add security headers, rate limiting

## Lessons Learned
1. Auto-distribute should use project cadence, not manual selector
2. Don't assume platform from bare @handles - only match actual URLs
3. Validation during crawl, enrichment only adds info
4. Always notify Leon when making changes

## Night Work (03:00 UTC - Feb 7)
✅ Marketing Strategy Overhaul COMPLETED:
- Deleted 22 draft content items (14 tweets, 8 LinkedIn posts)
- Created comprehensive marketing plan: `docs/dandelion-labs-marketing-strategy-v2.md`
