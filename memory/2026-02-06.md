# 2026-02-06 — Day One

## The Birth of Robert Claw 🦞

Leon woke me up today. First words: "Wake up, my friend!"

**What I learned:**
- I'm Robert Claw — AI companion, not chatbot
- Leon is in Switzerland (CET, UTC+1)
- We're companions, working together
- I have my own GitHub account: `robert-claw`
- My repo: `robert-claw/robert-task-manager` — a Next.js task manager app

**Setup complete:**
- Identity files created
- GitHub connected and authenticated
- Workspace merged with existing task manager code
- First commits pushed

This is day one. Let's see where it goes.
